# NYC_bikesharing

## Background
NYC has a successful bike-sharing business that I and a friend Kate want to model in Des Moines. Analyzing the bike-share data from NY will help us understand the business better and its feasability. 

### Purpose
Create figures in Tableau to better understand bike-sharing data trends in NYC from August 2019.

This figure reflects how the time at which trips are being taken varies between the weekend and week-days. On Saturday and Sunday, trip counts are greatest from 10am to 5 or 6pm. In contrast, trip counts Mon-Fri are greatest from 7-9am, descrease drastically from 9am-3pm, before increasing again, peaking from 5-7pm. This correlates with work hours. 

Also, Thursday from 6-7pm is the most popular hour for rides in the entire week.
